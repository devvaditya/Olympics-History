## Project Goals

My dashboard was designed to help users, such as sports coaches and national representatives, analyze historical standings and performance data for their countries or specific sports.

- **Visualize historical Olympic data:** Your dashboard effectively showcases a large amount of data about the Olympic Games from 1896 to 2016 including total medals awarded, top 5 medal-winning countries, top 5 sports by medal count, and top 5 athletes by total medal count.
- **Explore trends over time:** The dashboard allows users to examine trends in Olympic history by viewing medal counts across all games and filtering by factors such as sport and gender.
- **Identify patterns and insights:** The data visualization facilitates users in uncovering interesting patterns and stories within the data. For instance, users can see the United States has the most total medals, but Russia dominates the top 5 athletes by total medal count.
